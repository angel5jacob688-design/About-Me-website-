        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hey, I’m Angel Jacob — a student from Kerala who finds wonder in the little things.
            I’m that girl who pauses to admire the evening sky brushed with pink, or the quiet sparkle of a star-filled night.
            I love seeing beauty in simple moments — though it sometimes leaves me lost in thought.
            I enjoy exploring new possibilities and finding the “why” behind what I do.
            That sense of purpose keeps me grounded and inspired.

        <h3>My Creative Side</h3>
        <p>
            I’ve always been drawn to art — I love sketching people, objects, and abstract ideas that express emotion.
            To me, art isn’t just what we see on a canvas; it’s how we feel when we look at the world differently.
            Designing spaces and layouts — especially interior design — is something I quietly nurture as a side passion.

        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p>
            Right now, I’m pursuing my engineering degree while exploring the world of coding.
            I’m still at the beginning, but I love how programming combines creativity and logic.
            Developing my first web page feels like a small but meaningful step toward blending both —
            a step that excites me to keep learning and creating.

        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>
            My interests are a mix of imagination, empathy, and exploration.
            I love connecting ideas, people, and creativity in ways that help me grow.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drawing people, objects, and abstract ideas</li>
            <li>Designing interiors and visual layouts</li>
            <li>Reading and writing poetry and literature</li>
            <li>Learning about psychology and different perspectives</li>
            <li>Traveling and experiencing cultures and cuisines</li>
            <li>Enjoying rainy evenings, deep talks, and quiet walks</li>
            <li>Building web design and public speaking skills</li>
            <li>Strengthening teamwork, communication, and leadership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each of these passions adds to who I’m becoming — creative, thoughtful, and eager to keep evolving.

        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>
            I’m excited to see how I’ll grow into my future self — how the choices and habits I’m building now will shape who I become.
            Every small step feels like part of something larger I’m working toward.

        <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>
            One of the first steps I took in learning web development was exploring
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>.
            It really helped me understand the basics and guided me through this first page I’ve built.
